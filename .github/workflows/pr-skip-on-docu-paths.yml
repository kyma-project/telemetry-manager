#  If a workflow is skipped due to path filtering, branch filtering or a commit message, then checks associated with that workflow will remain in a "Pending" state. A pull request that requires those checks to be successful will be blocked from merging.
# This workflow implements a workaround that runs if only docu files were changed and makes nesessary coding and e2e required checks succeed.
