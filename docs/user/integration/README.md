# Integration Guides

Kyma's Telemetry module makes it easy for you to integrate the telemetry services you need. The following guides support you step by step:

If you'd like instructions how to integrate with several backends, check out the guides for [SAP Cloud Logging](./sap-cloud-logging/README.md), a [custom Loki stack](./loki/README.md), a [custom Jaeger stack](./jaeger/README.md), and [Amazon CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray](./aws-cloudwatch/README.md)

Learn about OpenTelemetry in a near real-world environment and see it in action with the [OpenTelemetry Demo App](./opentelemetry-demo/README.md).
