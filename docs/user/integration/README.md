# Integration Guides

If you're interested in learning how to integrate the Telemetry module, we've got you covered.

Learn about OpenTelemetry in a near real-world environment and see it in action with the [OpenTelemetry Demo App](https://github.com/kyma-project/examples/tree/main/trace-demo).

If you'd like instructions how to integrate with several back-ends, check out the guides for [SAP Cloud Logging](./cloudlogging/README.md), a [custom Loki stack](./loki/README.md), and a [custom Jaeger stack](./loki/README.md).
