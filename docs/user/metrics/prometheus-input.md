# Prometheus Input

To enable collection of Prometheus-based metrics, define a MetricPipeline that has the `prometheus` section enabled as input:

```yaml
apiVersion: telemetry.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: MetricPipeline
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  input:
    prometheus:
      enabled: true
  output:
    otlp:
      endpoint:
        value: https://backend.example.com:4317
```

> [!NOTE]
> For the following approach, you must have instrumented your application using a library like the [Prometheus client library](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/), with a port in your workload exposed serving as a Prometheus metrics endpoint.

## Endpoint Discovery

The Metric agent is configured with a generic scrape configuration, which uses annotations to specify the endpoints to scrape in the cluster.

For metrics ingestion to start automatically, use the annotations of the following table.
If an Istio sidecar is present, apply them to a Service that resolves your metrics port.
By annotating the Service, all endpoints targeted by the Service are resolved and scraped by the Metric agent bypassing the Service itself.
Only if Istio sidecar is not present, you can alternatively apply the annotations directly to the Pod.

| Annotation Key                                                   | Example Values    | Default Value | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|-------------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `prometheus.io/scrape` (mandatory)                               | `true`, `false` | none | Controls whether Prometheus Receiver automatically scrapes metrics from this target.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `prometheus.io/port` (mandatory)                                 | `8080`, `9100` | none | Specifies the port where the metrics are exposed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `prometheus.io/scheme` (only relevant when annotating a Service) | `http`, `https` | If Istio is active, `https` is supported; otherwise, only `http` is available. The default scheme is `http` unless an Istio sidecar is present, denoted by the label `security.istio.io/tlsMode=istio`, in which case `https` becomes the default. | Determines the protocol used for scraping metrics â€” either HTTPS with mTLS or plain HTTP. |
| `prometheus.io/param_<name>: <value>`                            | `prometheus.io/param_format: prometheus` | none | Instructs Prometheus Receiver to pass name-value pairs as URL parameters when calling the metrics endpoint. |

If you're running the Pod targeted by a Service with Istio, Istio must be able to derive the [appProtocol](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#application-protocol) from the Service port definition; otherwise the communication for scraping the metric endpoint cannot be established. You must either prefix the port name with the protocol like in `http-metrics`, or explicitly define the `appProtocol` attribute.

For example, see the following `Service` configuration:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/port: "8080"
    prometheus.io/scrape: "true"
  name: sample
spec:
  ports:
  - name: http-metrics
    appProtocol: http
    port: 8080
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: 8080
  selector:
    app: sample
  type: ClusterIP
```

> [!NOTE]
> The Metric agent can scrape endpoints even if the workload is a part of the Istio service mesh and accepts mTLS communication. However, there's a constraint: For scraping through HTTPS, Istio must configure the workload using 'STRICT' mTLS mode. Without 'STRICT' mTLS mode, you can set up scraping through HTTP by applying the annotation `prometheus.io/scheme=http`. For related troubleshooting, see [Log Entry: Failed to Scrape Prometheus Endpoint](./README.md#log-entry-failed-to-scrape-prometheus-endpoint).

## Filters

To filter metrics by namespaces, define a MetricPipeline that has the `namespaces` section defined in one of the inputs. For example, you can specify the namespaces from which metrics are collected or the namespaces from which metrics are dropped. Learn more about the available [parameters and attributes](resources/05-metricpipeline.md).

By default, the sidecars of all namespaces are getting collected excluding system namespaces. To include system namespaces as well, please explicitly configure an empty namespcae object: `namespaces: {}`.

The following example collects runtime metrics **only** from the `foo` and `bar` namespaces:

```yaml
apiVersion: telemetry.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: MetricPipeline
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  input:
    runtime:
      enabled: true
      namespaces:
        include:
          - foo
          - bar
  output:
    otlp:
      endpoint:
        value: https://backend.example.com:4317
```

The following example collects runtime metrics from all namespaces **except** the `foo` and `bar` namespaces:

```yaml
apiVersion: telemetry.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
kind: MetricPipeline
metadata:
  name: backend
spec:
  input:
    runtime:
      enabled: true
      namespaces:
        exclude:
          - foo
          - bar
  output:
    otlp:
      endpoint:
        value: https://backend.example.com:4317
```

## Diagnostic Metrics

If you use the `prometheus` or `istio` input, for every metric source typical scrape metrics are produced, such as `up`, `scrape_duration_seconds`, `scrape_samples_scraped`, `scrape_samples_post_metric_relabeling`, and `scrape_series_added`.

By default, they are disabled.

If you want to use them for debugging and diagnostic purposes, you can activate them. To activate diagnostic metrics, define a MetricPipeline that has the `diagnosticMetrics` section defined.

- The following example collects diagnostic metrics **only** for input `istio`:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: telemetry.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
  kind: MetricPipeline
  metadata:
    name: backend
  spec:
    input:
      istio:
        enabled: true
        diagnosticMetrics:
          enabled: true
    output:
      otlp:
        endpoint:
          value: https://backend.example.com:4317
  ```

- The following example collects diagnostic metrics **only** for input `prometheus`:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: telemetry.kyma-project.io/v1alpha1
  kind: MetricPipeline
  metadata:
    name: backend
  spec:
    input:
      prometheus:
        enabled: true
        diagnosticMetrics:
          enabled: true
    output:
      otlp:
        endpoint:
          value: https://backend.example.com:4317
  ```
