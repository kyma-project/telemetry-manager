# OTLP Output


The Telemetry module automatically detects whether the Istio module is added to your cluster, and injects Istio sidecars to the Telemetry components. Additionally, the ingestion endpoints of gateways are configured to allow traffic in the permissive mode, so they accept mTLS-based communication as well as plain text.

Clients in the Istio service mesh transparently communicate to the gateway with mTLS. Clients that don't use Istio can communicate with the gateway in plain text mode. The same pattern applies for the communication to the backends running in the cluster. External clusters use the configuration as specified in the pipelines output section.
