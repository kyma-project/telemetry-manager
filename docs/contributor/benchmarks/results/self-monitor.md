# Test Results: Self-Monitor

## Overview

The main KPIs to track performance changes are **scrape samples per sec** and **total series created**. These values
should be in the range of 15-22 samples/sec and 200-350 series, respectively.
Other metrics to track are **CPU** and **memory usage** of the self-monitor Pods. Both are directly influenced by the
number of series created and the scrape samples/sec: more samples and series created increase the memory and CPU usage
of the self-monitor Pods.
