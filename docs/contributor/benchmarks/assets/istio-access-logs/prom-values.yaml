    additionalScrapeConfigs:
      # Scrape config for service endpoints.
      #
      # The relabeling allows the actual service scrape endpoint to be configured
      # via the following annotations:
      #
      # * `prometheus.io/scrape`: Only scrape services that have a value of `true`
      # * `prometheus.io/scheme`: If the metrics endpoint is secured then you will need
      # to set this to `https` & most likely set the `tls_config` of the scrape config.
      # * `prometheus.io/path`: If the metrics path is not `/metrics` override this.
      # * `prometheus.io/port`: If the metrics are exposed on a different port to the
      # service then set this appropriately.
