# Governance

Some quality aspects are covered by automated verification, so you must locally execute tooling before a commitment. These aspects are outlined in this document.

## CRD Generation

The API of Telemetry Manager is realized by Kubernetes CRDs defined in the [apis](../../apis) folder as Golang source code. To install the CRDs later using Kustomize together with Telemetry Manager deployment, you must generate proper Kubernetes [manifest files](../../config/crd/bases). Also, you must update the [user documentation](../user/resources/).

To achieve both aspects, call:

```shell
make manifests
```

Additionally, a [Github Action](../../.github/workflows/pr-code-checks.yml) verifies this operation.

## Sourcecode Linting

For the source code linting, the development team uses [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run) with fine-grained configuration.

Additionally, a [Github Action](../../.github/workflows/pr-code-checks.yml) verifies this operation.

### Linters in Action

The following linters are configured and integrated as a CI stage using a [Github Action](../../.github/workflows/pr-code-checks.yml).

### Nolint

If linting warnings add noise to the development or are routinely ignored (for example, because some linters produce false-positive warnings), consider disabling the linter.
You can either suppress one or more lines of code inline, or exclude whole files.

> **TIP:** The benefit of declaring linter exclusion rules on a file basis in the config file and not as package-level inline nolint instructions is that it is easier to visualize and analyse the linting suppressions.

#### Suppress Linting Warnings Inline With //nolint

To suppress a linting warning for a particular line of code, use nolint instruction `//no-lint:{LINTER} // {COMMENT}.` For the _LINTER_ and _COMMENT_ placeholders, you must enter the linter to be suppressed and a reason for the suppression.

To suppress linting warnings for the whole block, use preceding inline nolint comments. The following example suppresses the linter for the entire file:

   ```go
   //nolint:errcheck // The error check should be suppressied for the module.
   package config

   // The rest of the file will not be linted by errcheck.
   ```

#### Suppress Linting Warnings for Whole Files

To prevent some files from being linted, use the section `.issues.exclude-rules` in the `.golangci.yaml` configuration file.

The code duplication linting scenario is problematic for being disabled an a per line basis. The following example suppresses the `dupl` linter for the set of three files in the _apis/telemetry/v1alpha1_ module:

   ```yaml
   issues:
     exclude-rules:
       - linters: [ dupl ]
         path: apis/telemetry/v1alpha1/(logparsers|metricpipeline|tracepipeline)_types_test.go
   ```

### Dev Environment Configuration

Read [golangci-lint integrations](https://golangci-lint.run/docs/welcome/integrations/) for information on configuring file-watchers for your IDE or code editor.

### Autofix

Some of the linting errors can be automatically fixed with the command:
`make lint_autofix`
