# Testing Strategy
​
This document summarises the software development testing life cycle activities and artefacts for the Telemetry module.
​
## Roles and Responsibilities
​
Software Testing Life Cycle phases:
​
| Phase | When | How | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Requirement analysis | Sprint planning, grooming and triaging meetings | Brainstorm the feature implementation, design and its implications on the testability | A clarified implementation design with a focus on testability, the acceptance tests criteria are collected, and the testing surface is defined as a part of the story |
| Test planning, design and development | Development phase during the sprint | The new functionality is covered with sufficient Unit, Integration and Acceptance-tests. | The unit and integration test suites are augmented, and new tests are integrated into the CI pipeline. All new functionality is covered with an Acceptance test. |
| Test execution | A part of the CI process | | |
​

The roles and responsibilities during the STLC:
​
| Role | Responsibilities | Performed by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PO` | Define acceptance criteria for the user stories, assess risks | Product Owner |
| `DEV` | Implement tests for new functionality, extend the test suites, adhere to the test coverage expectations | Development team |
| `ARCHITECT` | Devise system design with a focus on testability | Development team |
| `QA`| Define the testing coverage for each story, ensure the test suite is delivered along with each new piece of functionality. | Development team |
​
## Testing Levels
​
### Functional Tests
​
Unit and Env tests follow the [Go convention](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/add-a-test) and reside next to the code they are testing. The unit tests and integration tests are part of one test suite.
​
| Test suite | Testing level | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unit (located with the individual source files) | Unit | It tests the units in isolation. This test suite assesses the implementation correctness of the units of business logic. |
| Env-tests (located with the individual source files) | Integration  (low-level) | It tests the behaviour of the Telemetry Manager in integration with a Kubernetes API server replaced with a test double. This test suite assesses the integration correctness of the Telemetry Manager. |
| [E2E](/test/e2e) | Acceptance / Integration (high-level) | It tests the usability scenarios of the Telemetry Manager in a cluster. This test suite assesses the functional correctness of the Telemetry Manager. |
​
### Non-functional Tests
​
| Type | Automation | Frequency | Results |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Release testing | Manual | Regularly before each release | Manual tests |
| Performance tests | Manual | Ad hoc on a noticeable component change | Tests repository |
| Security tests (done SAP-internally) | Automated | | |
​
### Source Code Quality
​
The source code quality is maintained using a static code analysis provided by [golangci-lint](./governance.md).
​
The [configured linters](./governance.md#linters-in-action) analyse the following aspects:
​
- [x] Adherence to the code style standards
- [x] Code semantics
- [ ] The module's dependencies management
- [ ] The codebase's cognitive and cyclomatic complexity
​
## Test Deliverables
​
All testing-related deliverables, except for the `Release Testing` report and `Performance Tests` results, are integrated as stages of the Continuous Integration pipeline. 
​
Access the automated test reports with the following links:
