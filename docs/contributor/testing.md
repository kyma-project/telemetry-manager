# Testing Strategy

This document summarises the software development testing life cycle activities and artefacts for the Telemetry module.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Software Testing Life Cycle phases:

| Phase                                 | When                                            | How                                                                                                                              | Result                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Requirement analysis                  | Sprint planning, grooming and triaging meetings | Brainstorm the feature implementation, design and its implications on the testability.                                           | A clarified implementation design with a focus on testability, the acceptance tests criteria are collected, and the testing surface is defined as a part of the story. |
| Test planning, design and development | Development phase during the sprint             | Implement Unit and Acceptance tests for new functionalities.                                                                     | All functionalities are covered with Unit and Acceptance tests.                                                                                                        |
| Test validation                       | Acceptance phase during the sprint              | During the code review and iteration review, verify that the Test Suite correctly and completely covers the Acceptance Criteria. | The Acceptance Criteria are integrated into the E2E test suite and become a regression suite for future verification.                                                  |
| Test execution                        | A part of the CI process                        |                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                                                                                        |

![E2E Test Suites](assets/e2e-test-suites.png)

#### Testing of New Functionality

Testing a new functionality encompasses two activities: capturing the acceptance criteria for each new functionality and providing the requirements traceability. `Requirement` and `Test Suite` are linked by the Behavioural-Driven Testing DSL of the [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) testing framework. `User Story` and `Acceptance Criteria` are linked semi-automatically because acceptance criteria are a mandatory part of each user story with new functionality (using the PR-template checklist).

#### Testing of Existing Functionality

The regression test suite validates the correctness of the product's previously released functionalities using the "retest all" technique. It encompasses the end-to-end and operational test suites.

### Non-Functional Tests

| Type                                 | Automation      | Frequency                                                                                                | Results                       |
| ------------------------------------ |-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Performance tests                    | Semi-automated  | Automated performance tests are manually triggered when bumping images for Fluent Bit or OTel Collector  | `PR Load Test` Github action  |
| Security tests (done SAP-internally) | Automated       |                                                                                                          |                               |

### Source Code Quality

Most of the source code quality prerequisites are checked automatically in the following ways:

- The code-style requirements are collected and stored as a [configuration](governance.md#linters-in-action) for the fine-grained static analysis linters.
- The cognitive and cyclomatic complexity quality gateways are agreed upon and imposed using static analysis linters.
- Static code checks are implemented using [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run).
- The Continuous Integration pipeline for each PR controls the violations of static code rules.
- In the case of a problem, the PR is prevented from moving forward, and all involved parties are notified.
- This static code validation covers the whole codebase, including the test suites.
