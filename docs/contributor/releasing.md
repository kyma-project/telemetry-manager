# Releasing

## Release Process

This release process covers the steps to release new major and minor versions for the Kyma Telemetry module.

1. Verify that all issues in the [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/kyma-project/telemetry-manager/milestones) related to the version are closed.

2. Close the milestone.

3. Create a new [GitHub milestone](https://github.com/kyma-project/telemetry-manager/milestones) for the next version.

4. In the `telemetry-manager` repository, create a release branch.
   The name of this branch must follow the `release-x.y` pattern, such as `release-1.0`.

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout --no-track -b {RELEASE_BRANCH} upstream/main
   git push upstream {RELEASE_BRANCH}
   ```

5. Bump the `telemetry-manager/{RELEASE_BRANCH}` branch with the new versions for the dependent images.
   Create a PR to `telemetry-manager/{RELEASE_BRANCH}` with the following changes:
   - `.env`:  
     For the `ENV_IMG` variable, update the tag of the `telemetry-manager` image with the new module version following the `x.y.z` pattern. For example, `ENV_IMG=europe-docker.pkg.dev/kyma-project/prod/telemetry-manager:1.0.0`.
   - `config/manager/kustomization.yaml`:  
     Update the `newTag` field for the `telemetry-manager` image with the new module version following the `x.y.z` pattern, such as `1.0.0`.
   - `sec-scanners-config.yaml`:  
     For the images listed in the `protecode` field:
      - Update the tag of the `telemetry-manager` image with the new module version following the `x.y.z` pattern. For example, `europe-docker.pkg.dev/kyma-project/prod/telemetry-manager:1.0.0`.
      - Ensure that all other images have the same versions as those used in the `main.go` file.

6. Merge the PR.

7. In the `telemetry-manager/{RELEASE_BRANCH}` branch, create release tags for the head commit.

   ```bash
   git tag {RELEASE_VERSION}
   git tag {RELEASE_DEV_VERSION}
   ```

   Replace {RELEASE_VERSION} with the new module version, for example, `1.0.0`, and replace {RELEASE_DEV_VERSION} with the new development module version, for example, `1.0.0-dev`. The release tags point to the HEAD commit in `telemetry-manager/{RELEASE_BRANCH}` branch.

8. Push the tags to the upstream repository.

   ```bash
   git push upstream {RELEASE_VERSION}
   git push upstream {RELEASE_DEV_VERSION}
   ```

   The {RELEASE_VERSION} tag triggers a post-submit Prow Job (`post-telemetry-manager-build-release`) and a GitHub action (`GitHub Release`). The `post-telemetry-manager-build-release` job builds the `telemetry-manager` image, tags it with the module version, and pushes it to the production registry. The `GitHub Release` action creates the GitHub release.

9. Verify the [status](https://status.build.kyma-project.io/) of the post-submit Prow Job (`post-telemetry-manager-build-release`) and the [status](https://github.com/kyma-project/telemetry-manager/actions) of the GitHub action (`GitHub Release`).
   - Once the post-submit Prow Job and the GitHub action succeed, the new GitHub release is available under [releases](https://github.com/kyma-project/telemetry-manager/releases).
   - If the post-submit Prow Job or the GitHub action fails, re-trigger them by removing the {RELEASE_VERSION} tag from upstream and pushing it again:

     ```bash
     git push --delete upstream {RELEASE_VERSION}
     git push upstream {RELEASE_VERSION}
     ```

10. If the previous release was a bugfix version (patch release) that contains cherry-picked changes, these changes might appear again in the generated change log. Edit the release description and remove redundant entries if necessary.

## Changelog

Every PR's title must adhere to the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification for an automatic changelog generation. It is enforced by a [semantic-pull-request](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/semantic-pull-request) GitHub Action.

### Pull Request Title

Due to the Squash merge GitHub Workflow, each PR results in a single commit after merging into the main development branch. The PR's title becomes the commit message and must adhere to the template:

`type(scope?): subject`

#### Type

- **feat**. A new feature or functionality change.
- **fix**. A bug or regression fix.
- **docs**. Changes regarding the documentation.
- **test**. The test suite alternations.
- **deps**. The changes in the external dependencies.
- **chore**. Anything not covered by the above categories (e.g., refactoring or artefacts building alternations).

Beware that PRs of type `chore` do not appear in the Changelog for the release. Therefore, exclude maintenance changes that are not interesting to consumers of the project by marking them with chore type:

- Dotfile changes (.gitignore, .github, and so forth).
- Changes to development-only dependencies.
- Minor code style changes.
- Formatting changes in documentation.

#### Subject

The subject must describe the change and follow the recommendations:

- Describe a change using the [imperative mood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood).  It must start with a present-tense verb, for example (but not limited to) Add, Document, Fix, Deprecate.
- Start with an uppercase, and not finish with a full stop.
- Kyma [capitalization](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/docs/guidelines/content-guidelines/02-style-and-terminology.md#capitalization) and [terminology](https://github.com/kyma-project/community/blob/main/docs/guidelines/content-guidelines/02-style-and-terminology.md#terminology) guides.
