# 11. Impact of Istio-Envoy Metrics Merge Feature on MetricPipeline's Prometheus Input

Date: 2024-10-21

## Status

Proposed

## Context

The MetricPipeline supports various input types, including prometheus and istio.
* When the prometheus input is enabled, it scrapes metrics from Pods and Services annotated with prometheus.io/scrape=true.
* When the istio input is enabled, it scrapes metrics from the Istio proxy (sidecar) containers injected into Pods.

Both inputs are technically backed by the OpenTelemetry (OTel) Collectorâ€™s Prometheus Receiver. There are five distinct scrape jobs, each targeting different configurations:

| Scrape Job | Targets |
| --- | --- |
| app-pods | Scrapes annotated Pods that either do not have an Istio sidecar or have the prometheus.io/scheme explicitly set to http. Scraping is done over plain HTTP. |
| app-services | Scrapes annotated Services backed by Pods without an Istio sidecar or where the prometheus.io/scheme is explicitly set to http (on Services). Scraping is done over plain HTTP. |
| app-pods-secure | Scrapes annotated Pods that either have an Istio sidecar or have the prometheus.io/scheme set to https. Scraping is performed over HTTPS, using a client TLS certificate injected by Istio. |
| app-services-secure | Scrapes annotated Services backed by Pods with an Istio sidecar or where the prometheus.io/scheme is set to https (on Services). Scraping is done over HTTPS, using a client TLS certificate injected by Istio. |
| istio-proxy | Scrapes metrics from Istio proxy sidecars, with scraping performed over plain HTTP. |
