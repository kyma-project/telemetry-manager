# 12b. Leader Receiver Creator as Extension

Date: 2024-11-08

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The Telemetry OTel Collector collects metrics exposed by the Kubernetes API server using [k8sclusterreceiver](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/receiver/k8sclusterreceiver), and custom resource metrics are collected using [kymastatsreceiver](https://github.com/kyma-project/opentelemetry-collector-components/tree/main/receiver/kymastatsreceiver).
To run these receivers in high availability mode and prevent sending duplicate metrics, we've implemented [Singleton Receiver Creator](https://github.com/kyma-project/opentelemetry-collector-components/tree/v0.1.16/receiver/singletonreceivercreator) based on [Leader Receiver Creator](./012a-leader-receiver-creator.md).

## Decision

However, after feedback from community and careful deliberation, we realize the `singleonreceivercreator` would be better suited to be used as an extension.
[Extensions](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/extension/README.md?plain=1) provide additional functionality to the collector, but do not need direct access to telemetry data and are not part of the pipelines.

Implementing `singleonreceivercreator` as an extension brings the following advantages:

- It is signal-agnostic.
- It can be used with any receiver.
- It brings simpler and clear configuration.
- It's future-proof.

It has following disadvantages:

- The receivers must be modified to support the leader election extension.

### Leader Election API

```yaml
receivers:
  dummy/foo:
    interval: 1m
    leaderelector: leaderelector/foo
  dummy/bar:
    interval: 1m
    leaderelector: leaderelector/bar
extensions:
  leaderelector/foo:
    auth_type: kubeConfig
    lease_name: foo
    lease_namespace: default
  leaderelector/bar:
    auth_type: kubeConfig
    lease_name: bar
    lease_namespace: default
```

The leader elector extension would contain the configuration providing lease name and namespace. This extension would be then referenced in the receivers.

The Singleton Receiver Creator would be deprecated and removed. The `kymastatsreceiver` and `k8sclusterreceiver` would use the leader elector extension for leader election.

The change would also require changes in the `k8sclusterreceiver` to support the leader election extension.
