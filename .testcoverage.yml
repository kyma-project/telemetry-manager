# Holds regexp rules which will exclude matched files or packages from coverage statistics
exclude:
  # Exclude files or packages matching their paths
  paths:
    - ^apis # apis should in general only contain Go structs and not unit tested
    - ^controllers # controllers are covered by e2e tests
    - main
    - mocks
    - stubs

# NOTES:
# - symbol `/` in all path regexps will be replaced by
#   current OS file path separator to properly work on Windows
